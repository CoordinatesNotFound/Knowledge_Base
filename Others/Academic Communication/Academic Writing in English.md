## 1 Audience, purpose and form



### 1.1 Audience (or readers)



#### 1.1.1 Communication as problem solving

Lannon (2006) describes *a communicator as a problem solver*. When engineers or scientists prepare documents, their task is to solve a communication problem of *delivering usable information* to their audience. To solve the communication problem, another important question is **How do I meet my audience’s information needs?**

To unravel this main question, you can ask other related questions:

- How much information does this audience already know?
- How much detail can they take?
- What information on this subject does this audience need?
- Is a formal or informal style more appropriate for this audience?



#### 1.1.2 Types of audience

There are numerous types of audiences depending on the categorization. Here is a general categorization that can be helpful for getting started in the audience analysis.

- **General / non-technical**
  - General audience implies that a wide range of people might be reading the document. Newspapers tend to be geared towards general public.
  - In a company setting, this could concern all workers in the company with variying backgrounds and job descriptions.
  - A patient visiting a doctor can be such audience.
- **Informed / semi-technical**
  - Informed audience knows more about a specific topic and understands more technical information than general public. Popular science magazines, such as Discover or Scientific American, could be examples of publications that write contents for informed readers who are interested in recent discoveries of science without having to know all the technical details.
  - In a company or at university, this could refer to a specific unit or department who share certain level of background knowledge.
  - A specialized nurse working at a hospital has much knowledge of medical practices while understanding the needs of both doctors/surgeons and the patient.
- **Expert / highly technical**
  - Experts have deep and perhaps highly technical knowledge about a particular field. They can analyze and evaluate highly technical information. Nevertheless, even experts are not experts in everything.
  - Companies often employ teams of experts who may be the only person able to maintain and operate a key device or system.
  - In a hospital, this could refer to doctors or other specialists who are capable of evaluating specific data and research.

In academia, a similar three-layered categorization could be based on prior knowledge of the audience. When presenting technical or research information withing a field of science, these groups usually need different amounts of information: first year student in theoretial physics require more basic explanations than the professor when concerning many phenomena in physics.

- Low prior knowledge
  - Student
- Low to intermediate prior knowledge
  - General academic audience
- High prior knowledge
  - Researcher / professor



### 1.2 Purpose



#### 1.2.1 Purpose for communication

When solving a communication problem, you also need to specify the purpose of the communication. Usually, the aspects of audience and purpose are considered simultaneously. In some cases, you might be give an assignment to prepare a document for a given purpose, and then you start thinking about the audience needs.

Similar to audience, there can be many purposes for communication. The main question to ask is as follows: **What are you hoping to achieve with this text?**

The main question can be further probed by asking:

- What is the primary purpose of writing this text?
- Are there secondary purposes?



#### 1.2.2 Types of purposes

Writing a document may involve a variety of purposes, and these are influenced by the target audience, as discussed in the previous section. The document may have one primary purpose, such as to inform, and secondary purposes, such as to persuade, which may influence the contents to some degree. Below you find a list of four types of purposes:

- **to inform**
  - What do you want the audience to *know* when you are done? Other similar purposes include *to define* and *describe*. A strictly informative document could be a train schedule.
- **to persuade**
  - What do you want the audience to do, believe or agree with? For example, a feasibility or recommendation report may recommend a plan of action or adoption of a technology based on certain criteria. A research article may promote adoption of a new theory or convince the readers that old knowledge should be replaced with new knowledge. Naturally, there is always some informing included in the process.
- **to teach**
  - What do want the audience to learn? This is a relevant question in many educational institutes. In engineering contexts, you might need to prepare instructions that allows other engineers or other workers to operate a device or software.
- **to entertain**
  - This may not be a common purpose in technical or academic writing, but sometimes a bit of humour can help readers to pay attention and get the message across. In fact, some research paper titles can be purposefully witty to attract attention. Presentations for general audience, such as those in TED Talks, definitely aim to include some entertainment to make the contents more interesting for general audience. The entertainment factor may relevant when popularizing your research.



### 1.3 Form and style



#### 1.3.1 Form and style

Once you have defined your primary audience and purpose, it is easier to decide the optimal format and style that you expect has the desired effect on your audience. The form of a document is determined by your intended audience and purpose. A central question to ask is **What form will best accomplish my purpose with this particular audience?**

Other relevant questions include

1. Is there a *model* or *format* that you should follow?
2. Would *formal or informal* writing be more appropriate for your audience and purpose?
3. How can you best *organize* your information to have the greatest impact on your audience?



#### 1.3.2 Genre

The term *genre* comes from the French (originally Latin) word for a *kind* or *class*. In written contexts, a genre can be defined as a type of text characterized by a similar

- *purpose* (e.g., to inform to to persuade)
- *form* (e.g., organization, grammar, and word choice) and
- particular *audience* (e.g., expert vs. non-expert).

The technical genre can cover a range of different text types, including

- research articles
- technical reports
- conference papers
- lab reports
- user’s instruction manuals
- technical documentation
- master’s theses.





## 2 Writing an introduction section



### 2.1 Patterns for writing texts

There are multiple patterns available for organizing texts and paragraphs depending on their purpose. Here we discuss a couple of useful patterns that are well-suited for introduction sections (or any academic text): the *general-to-specific* pattern and *problem-solution* pattern. These patterns are often applied to presentations as well.

- General-to-specific pattern
  - The *general-to-specific pattern* is a universal pattern that can be applied in many situations to organize information for readers. This pattern is closely linked with the [given-new principle](http://sana.aalto.fi/awe/cohesion/infostrux/given/index.html), which states that familiar information should be presented first followed by new information.
  - It is easier for a reader to understand your ideas if you begin with general information that is widely known. In contrast, starting with highly specific details that maybe be unfamiliar to some readers, can be annoying and confusing to read. Therefore, when writing a text, start with general information and provide “the big picture” and then gradually proceed towards the details.

- Problem-solution pattern

  - The problem-solution pattern is another highly common and useful rhetorical pattern in science and engineering writing, and it can be applied for various contexts. In fact, this pattern can often be found in maganize and newspaper writing. The problem-solution pattern consists of four steps: situation, problem, solution and evaluation, as illustrated below.
    ```
    Problem-solution pattern
    
    Step 1. Situation
    provides the general context or background about the topic.
    
    Step 2. Problem
    introduces the problem that relates to the situation.
    
    Step 3. Solution
    presents solutions that could or will solve the problem.
    
    Step 4. Evaluation
    provides an analysis that estimates the effectiveness of the proposed solution.
    ```



### 2.2 The CARS model for introduction sections

- MOVE 1: Establishing a territory // Situation

  - Step 1: Claiming centrality
  - Step 2: Making topic generalizations
  - Step 3: Reviewing previous research

- MOVE 2: Establishing a niche // Problems

  - Step 1: Counter-claiming // showing weakness in previous research
  - Step 2: Indicating a gap
  - Step 3: Question-raising
  - Step 4: Continuing a tradition

- MOVE 3: Presenting current work // New solution

  - Step 1: Announcing present research descriptively and/or purposively

  - Step 2: Presenting RQs or hypotheses
  - Step 3: Definitional clarifications
  - Step 4: Summarizing methods
  - Step 5: Announcing principal outcomes
  - Step 6: Stating the value of the present research
  - Step 7: Outlining the structure of the paper



## 3 Given-new principle



### 3.1 Identifying the subjects and main verbs

One of the most important steps in understanding whether a sentence follows the given-new principle is to identify the locations of the `main verb` and **subject** in each sentence. Once you have identified the main verb, it is usually quite easy to locate the subject of the sentence, which is typically immediately on the left side of the main verb. 

As some ideas in a sentence often need clarification in technical writing, there may be additional information after the subject and before the main verb, such as examples and comments, which are typically separated from the main clause using commas.



### 3.2 Given-new principle



#### 3.2.1 Definitions

- What is given/familiar information?
  - Concepts or objects that have already been discussed or are presumed to be understood from the context.

- What is new information?
  - Concepts or objects that have not been discussed earlier or presumed to be unfamiliar from the context.



#### 3.2.2 Four key principles

1. Put given before new information

   (i.e., familiar information at the beginning of a sentence).

2. Put topical information in the subject position

   (i.e., at the beginning of a sentence).

3. Put light before heavy noun phrases

   (i.e., the light-before-heavy principle).

4. Put action into the verb

   (i.e., use active verbs)



### 3.3 Three patterns of topical progression



#### 3.3.1 Constant topic

In the **constant topic pattern**, the keyword or topic is repeated in a text in the subject of a sentence. This approach helps the reader to easily see what the text is about and how ideas are connected to each other. Although this kind of repetition may first seem naive or simplistic, you will find that this pattern is frequently used in academic writing in engineering sciences.



#### 3.3.2 Stepwise topic

The **stepwise topic pattern** is a very convenient way to introduce a new topic area in a text. When applying the given-new principle, you are encouraged to keep the **familiar information** at the beginning of each sentence and place the **new information** at the end of the sentence. Naturally, the new information can be used at the beginning of the next sentence as familiar information.



#### 3.3.3 Hypertopic

The hypertopic pattern allows you to introduce many seemingly different topics under a more general concept. The hypertopic pattern always requires the use of a topic sentence (usually at the beginning of a paragraph) to inform the reader how the upcoming concepts relate to each other.



### 3.4 Avoiding needless repetition

Although direct repetition helps to ensure cohesion in a text, excessive repetition can sometimes make tedious to read or otherwise make texts seem overly simplistic

Types of familiar or repeated information:

- Direct repetition (OK if not excessive)

  > **A light bulb** is a component that produces visible light from electric current.
  >
  > **A light bulb** …

- Generic forms: a(n)/the + singular or Ø plural

  > **A solar panel** is a packaged interconnected assembly of solar cells.
  >
  > **The solar panel** is used as a component in …
  >
  > **Solar panels** use light energy (photons) …

- Acronyms and abbreviations

  > **A light-emitting diode (LED)** is a semiconductor light source.
  >
  > **LEDs** are used as indicator lamps in many devices, and are increasingly used for lighting.
  >
  > The color of **an LED** is determined by the semiconductor material, not by the coloring of the plastic body.

- This/These + repeated noun/superordinate

  > *By using a this/these or such (a) plus the exact term or a* **superordinate**.
  >
  > Tires that are fully worn out can be re-manufactured to replace the worn tread.
  >
  > **This process** is known as retreading or recapping.

- Demonstrative pronoun (this + Ø)

  > *Use “bald”* **this** *to refer back to an entire idea or sentence.*
  >
  > Tires that are fully worn out can be re-manufactured to replace the worn tread.
  >
  > **This** is known as retreading or recapping.

-  Repetition using pronouns (it/ they)

  > *By substituting a recently topical noun with* **it/they**. WARNING! *Do not overuse “it” in your writing* because links between ideas can easily become very ambiguous.
  >
  > **Modern tires** are fabricated from rubber and fabric along with other compound chemicals.
  >
  > **They** consist of a tread and a body.



## 4 Citing sources and avoiding plagiarism



### 4.1 Terminology



#### 4.1.1 References

In a journal paper or a master’s thesis, you can find a list of *References* at the end of the document. There are many reasons for including the References section in a paper. References provide readers a list information sources and literature that the writer has consulted during the writing process. In fact, writers also need to remember which sources have already been discussed in the paper and where the ideas can be found. Otherwise, the writers themselves would also forget this information after reading tens of papers about similar topics. Without proper referencing systems, the scientific progress would probably slow down considerably and be filled with errors because it would be difficult to locate particular facts and information to verify their correctness.

In their simplest form, references typically consist of the following information: *author names, year of publication, title of text, publication name* and *publisher*.

Below you can find examples of the same reference in APA (American Psychological Association) and IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) referencing systems. They contain more or less the same details, but names are ordered differently and IEEE also uses quotations.
```
Example references

Author-date (APA)
Drost, R., Ojanen, T., Harju, A., and Liljeroth, P. (2017). Topological states in engineered atomic lattices. Nature Physics, 13:668. doi: 10.1038/nphys4080.

Numeric (IEEE)
[1] R. Drost, T. Ojanen, A. Harju, and P. Liljeroth, “Topological states in engineered atomic lattices,” Nature Physics, vol. 13, p. 668, mar 2017. doi: 10.1038/nphys4080.
```



#### 4.1.2 Citations

*Citations* are abbreviated in-text references, such as [1] or (Drost et al., 2017), providing the reader information about the consulted source text that the writers use as an evidence to support their claims. Based on the number or lastname in the citation, you can find the full reference in the References section.

The citations in *author-date reference* systems typically include two components surrounded by parenthesis, i.e., the author name(s) and year of publication. In some cases, the in-text citations may also include page numbers if the exact location of the information is relevant. If the publication, such as a journal article, includes *three or more* authors, it is quite common to abbreviate the in-text citation by listing only the surname of the first author, and then use the Latinate expression *et al.*, which can be translated as “and others”. In author-date systems, the references section is arranged in alphabetical order.

```
Drost et. al (2017)

(Drost et. al, 2017)
```

Citations in *Numeric reference* systems contain only one component, i.e., the citation number. The citation numbers usually start from 1 and gradually increase throughout the document. In this case, the references section is also organized in ascending order based on the citation numbers, as in the IEEE format.

If interested, here are two example texts using the IEEE and APA citations formats.

#### 4.1.3 Citation styles

**Information-prominent citation style** places the focus on the topic of discussion, idea or thing. In practice, this is done by placing the topic into the subject position in each sentence.

> **The use of cloud computing** has rapidly increased in the industry *[12]*. // Subject in bold.

**The author-prominent citation style** emphasizes on the statements, viewpoints and achievements for authors. In this case, the author of a cited source is placed at the subject position in a sentence. When using the IEEE format, this approach can be useful for reviewing literature.

> **Smith et al. [2]** found that the use of cloud computing has rapidly increased in the industry. // Subject in bold.





#### 4.1.4 Formatting references

In the past, the authors had to type and update the list of references manually (and some do even today), which is a quite tedious and error-prone process. In practice, most word processors (e.g., Word) include a feature that formats the references for you if you download the references is a standard format. This makes life much easier since computers are good at manipulating or sorting information.

Many technical fields prefer LaTeX, which can modify `.bib` files into a nicely formatted list of references. If you are new to LaTeX, it is easy to get started by trying out the [Overleaf](http://www.overleaf.com/) online LaTeX editor. Aalto University provides free Professional accounts for students, faculty and staff. 

**Reference management systems**

If you need to collect and read large numbers of papers, it may be worthwhile to manage the references with a reference management system. [Aalto University Learning Centre](http://libguides.aalto.fi/c.php?g=410674&p=2797604) provides a list common management software, such as RefWorks, Mendeley, Zotero and JabRef.



#### 4.1.5 Quotation, paraphrase and summary

- Quotation
  - = exact same wording of the source text (copy-paste) indicated by double quotation marks “…” or single ‘…’.
- Paraphrase
  - explaining the same idea in different words (i.e., your words).
- Summary
  - a much shorter explanation (using your own words) of the ideas presented in an article or a book chapter.



### 4.2 When to cite sources?



#### 4.2.1 Specific knowledge

MIT’s citation guidelines state that the following sources require citations since they typically contain specific information, ideas or statistics whose source can be attributed:

- Print sources: books, journal articles, newspaper - any material published on paper.
- Electronic sources
- Data
- Images
- Recorded material
- Spoken material



#### 4.2.2 Common knowledge

In academic writing, common knowledge can be defined as such information that most people are aware of within some field of study, or even within larger groups of people, such as nations.

To determine whether information is common knowledge or not, MIT’s citation guidelines recommends to ask yourself the following:

- Who is my audience?
- What can I assume they already know?
- Will I be asked where I obtained my information?



### 4.3 Reporting research and results



#### 4.3.1 Reporting verbs

When citing sources and reporting the results of your own work, it is very helpful to know the most common verbs and expressions needed in engineering and science writing.

| **accept**      | **comment**     | **dispute**     | **imply**     | **point out** | **speculate**   |
| :-------------- | --------------- | --------------- | ------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| **acknowledge** | **concede**     | **document**    | **indicate**  | **predict**   | **state**       |
| **add**         | **conclude**    | **doubt**       | **infer**     | **presume**   | **stress**      |
| **admit**       | **confirm**     | **emphasize**   | **inform**    | **proposes**  | **suggest**     |
| **agree**       | **conjecture**  | **establish**   | **insist**    | **+prove**    | **suppose**     |
| **allege**      | **+consider**   | **+estimate**   | **judge**     | **recognise** | **surmise**     |
| **anticipate**  | **contend**     | **+expect**     | **+know**     | **recommend** | **+suspect**    |
| **argue**       | **+decide**     | **+feel**       | **maintain**  | **+report**   | **tell**        |
| **assert**      | **demonstrate** | **+find**       | **mention**   | **reveal**    | **+think**      |
| **+assume**     | **deny**        | **hold**        | **note**      | **+show**     | **+understand** |
| **+believe**    | **determine**   | **+hope**       | **+observe**  | **say**       | **warn**        |
| **+claim**      | **+discover**   | **hypothesize** | **+perceive** | **+see**      |                 |

> +verbs, such as “find” and “know”, which can also he used with a “to”-infinitive clause.



#### 4.3.2 IEEE and ACM referencing systems (numeric)

In general, the IEEE and AMC citation systems (numeric) use author names in in-text citations quite sparingly, but some journals allow a mix of author-names and numeric citations when reviewing literature.

> Examples (no author name / passive voice)
>
> The TCP/IP protocol **is widely used** … [1].
>
> A novel method **was proposed in** [2] to estimate …
>
> It **has been reported that** 70% of users rely on … [5].

If the writer is not careful, this approach can sometimes lead to the overuse of passive voice and even [top-heavy sentences](http://sana.aalto.fi/awe/cohesion/infostrux/light/strategies/index.html). The overuse of passive can be avoided by choosing a subject that naturally allows the use of *simple present tense*.

> Examples (no author name / active voice in present tense)
>
> *Quick sort* [7] **is** one of the fastest sorting algorithms.
>
> The concept of NP-completeness [12] **allows** …
>
> *The Bellman-Ford algorithm* **solves** the single-source shortest-path problem in … [8].

Depending on the journal the use of author names allow variety or clarity when writing literature reviews. This also emphasizes the work completed by the authors of cited sources. Typically, it is possible to use simple present tense.

> Examples (present tense)
>
> Douglas [1] **claims** the TCP/IP protocol …
>
> Smith et al. [3] **suggest** an alternative approach …
>
> Johnson [4] **assumes** the growth rate to be linear …

In some cases, *past tense* is used to refer to earlier research.

> Examples (past tense)
>
> Singh and Virtanen [6] **proposed** that …
>
> Jameson [5] **reported** that 71% of users rely on …
>
> A novel method **was proposed by** Smith [2] to estimate …

When referring to general research trends with topic sentences, it is common to use *present perfect tense*: **has/have -ed** or **has/been -ed**.

> Examples (present perfect tense)
>
> Recently, much research **has focused on** the challenges of parallel computing in … [2,3,5,7,11].
>
> Shortest-path algorithms **have been compared** in [9] and [11] to evaluate their suitability for …
>
> Many studies [4,6,9,12] **have addressed** the k-coloring problem.

In some cases, it is necessary to refer to the results of previous research. If exact author names are not used, writers have found alternative expressions to achieve the same function.

> Examples (no author name / active voice in past tense)
>
> The work in [3] **developed** a novel method for optimizing …
>
> The authors in [3] **developed** a novel method for optimizing … // Avoid this form and prefer above approaches

To avoid the use of passive, writers sometimes attempt various creative strategies, some of which are quite peculiar workarounds.

> Ref [2] proposed a new algorithm … // This is sometimes used, but it is NOT recommended.
>
> [2] developed an approach … // Using a citation number as subject is *very bad style*.



### 4.4 Citing sources at paragraph level

When basing a paragraph on a single citation, begin the sentence with a topic sentence and repeat the keywords to create cohesion between ideas. The text should be written so clearly that the reader does not need to guess when cited material begins and ends. The key idea is repetition of *exact words*: using synonyms would create confusion and misunderstandings.

For example:

> 1Highly interactive data-driven Web Applications, or *Web Applications* in short, are usually based on the so-called three-tier architecture [2]. 2The *presentation* tier (i.e., user interface) is defined using HTML and CSS languages, and complemented with numerous JavaScript embeddings for client-side application logic. 3The *logic* tier (i.e., server-side application logic) is based either on an object-oriented (e.g., Java or Ruby) or scripting (e.g., PHP) language and uses HTML, XML, or JSON formats for client–server communication. 4Finally, the *data* tier (i.e., application data) uses either an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library or SQL statements for data management.

Although the paragraph contains many details and abbreviations, the basic structure is clear. Sentence 1 in the paragraph is known as the topic sentence (For details, see [topic sentences](http://sana.aalto.fi/awe/cohesion/topsen/index.html)), which states the main idea of the whole paragraph. The topic is *Web applications* and the controlling idea *three-tier archicture*. Each of the remaining sentences briefly defines the three tiers. Vuorimaa et al. (2016) have even used emphasis (i.e., italics) to indicate the repeating keywords to make this connection apparent.



## 5 Style and form



### 5.1 Formal grammar

- Avoid contractions

## 6 Light-before-heavy principle



### 6.1 Keep it "light"

English prefers sentences that contain a short subject, come quickly to the verb and then can go as long as needed. However, what is most undesirable are sentences that are "top-heavy". In other words, you should avoid overloading your reader by placing heavy elements at the beginning of the sentence. Instead, English prefers "heavybottomed" sentences —those that place most of the information at the end of the sentence after the verb.

## 7 Definitions



### 7.1 Parenthetical definitions

Parenthetical definition are used to explain a term briefly in parenthesis or between commas using synonyms or examples. This section discusses typical cases for short definitions needed in academic and technical writing, such as reports, journal articles and theses. 



#### 7.1.1 Abbreviations

When using an abbreviation for the first time in a text, the spelled-out full form of the term should also be provided to ensure readers know how to decipher its meaning.

> The original, inefficient indoor lighting systems were replaced with new lights equipped with energy-efficient light-emitting diodes (LEDs). These LEDs have the same luminosity as the old incandescent light bulbs.



#### 7.1.2 Common phrases for introducing examples

- such as
  = for example

- including
  = for example. 1) There are several cases, but here are a few …2) Highlighting an important example not to be forgotten.

- e.g.
  = exempli gratia = for example, for instance

- i.e.
  = id est = that is, in other words



#### 7.1.3 Common verbs

> A USB flash drive, also `known as` a USB drive, is a …





### 7.2 Sentence definitions

A typical, good sentence definition consists of three elements:

1. Term
   - = object / concept to be defined

2. Class
   - = group to which the thing belongs

3. Characteristics
   - = specific details that separate it from others in the same class.



### 7.3 Extended definitions

Eight Methods for extending your definition:

- Analysis of parts What are its parts? classes? types?
- Operating principles How does it work?
- Applications / Examples How is it used or applied?
- Analogy/ Comparison Is it similar to something familiar?
- History What is its origin? Who developed it?
- Advantages/ problems
- Requirements What is needed to make it work?
- Physical appearance/ features What does it look like? What are its characteristic features?



## 8 Avoiding weak verbs



### 8.1 Put “action” into the verb

- Avoid “there is…”

  > - There are several important factors that must be considered in the design of a
  >   nuclear power plant.
  > - Several important factors must be considered in the design of a nuclear
  >   power plant

- Avoid using *generic verbs to hide action in noun phrases

  > - An analysis of the framework was performed using standard criteria.
  > - The digital framework was analyzed using standard criteria.

- Avoid using “to be” to hide action in noun phrases 

  > - The first developer of the JavaScript language was Netscape.
  > - The JavaScript language was first developed by Netscape.



### 8.2 Shift the “topic” to the Beginning of Noun Phrases

- Avoid using “to be” to introduce numerical results

  - Notice how when presenting numerical data, English prefers to use a partitive–of structure, have + a [variable] of, rather than the verb “to be”: 

    > - The substrate thickness of the DVD is only 0.6 mm.
    >   (focus on new information ‘substrate thickness’)
    > - The DVD has a substrate thickness of only 0.6 mm.
    >   (focus on familiar, topical information ‘DVD’)

  ```

  



## 9 Commas



### 9.1 Rule #1: Place commas before subject

Typical grammatical elements and words preceding subjects:

1. Sentence connectors
   ```
   However, Furthermore, In addition, Therefore, Thus, As a result.
   ```

2. Introductory phrases
   ```
   Recently, Currently, Typically, Traditionally, In order to <verb>, According to X, Unlike Y.
   ```

3. Subordinate clauses
   ```
   as, although, because, since, when, whereas, while
   ```

4. Main clauses
   - When two independent main clauses, both of which have their own subject, are combined into one sentence using a conjunction **and**, **but** or **yet**, a comma is placed before the conjunction preceding the subject.

     > Ex (**Subject 1** …**,** and **subject** 2 …)
     >
     > **Helsinki** is located at the coast of Baltic sea**,** and **it** has many sea ports both for cargo and passengers.
     >
     > **Maija** is a chemical engineer**,** and **she** currently works at Neste.
     >
     > **Albert Einstein** predicted the existence of gravitational waves already in 1916**,** but **the actual dectection of such waves** required one hundred years of technological development.

   



### 9.2 Rule #2: Place commas around additional information

Typical grammatical elements that are separated from the main clauses with commas:

1. Parenthetical definitions

   - When providing short definitions or examples, commas are used to separate them from the main sentence. Such information can be considered as additional explanations that could be removed from a sentence without changing the meaning of the main message. Sometimes examples are listed in brackets `()`, but it is less common in academic writing. Dashes `--` are occasionally used only in some specific fields outside engineering writing. If you remove the examples in the sentences below, the sentences are still grammatically correct.

     > Many inhabitants in the capital region use **public transportation**, such as trains, subway and busses**,** as their primary mode of transportation.

2. Appositives

   - Commas are also used in **appositives**, i.e., when renaming people or defining concepts.

     > **Tarja Halonen**, the former president of Finland**,** currently works for the UN.

3. Non-defining relative clauses

   - The punctuation of relative clauses is sometimes a quite challenging area because in some cases adding or omitting comma will chance the meaning of a sentence.
   - **Non-essential (non-restrictive, non-defining or nice-to-know) information** is separated using commas and “which”.
   - **Essential (restrictive, defining) information** begins with **“that”** or **“which”** without comma.

4. Resultative -ing clauses

   -  resultative -ing clauses is a useful grammatical structure when emphasizing cause-effect relationships between ideas. As a pattern, it is less common than the other types of additional information, but it is a useful alternative expression to replace relative clauses or sentences ending with a verb.

     > Locally produced goods and services tend to be more expensive than those imported from other countries**,** **resulting** in higher costs for these firms.



### 9.3 Rule #3: Place commas between items in a list

This basic rule is probably common knowledge to almost every writer. In many cases, the lists we write tend to be simple and short, which causes no problem for understanding. In the examples below, *no comma* is placed before `and`.
