## 3 Technologies in 5G 



### 3.1 Enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB) 

- eMBB
  - A natural development of the existing LTE and LTE-Advanced networks that provides faster data rates and a better user experience than older mobile broadband services
  -  Is designed to cover high data rates, high density (e.g. peak usage at stadium events), and high mobility cases
  - Sub-use cases with 5G
    - Hot spots: eMBB can enhance broadband access in densely populated areas, boosting indoor and outdoor coverage in high-rise buildings and crowded city centres. 
    - Public transportation: Broadband access on high-speed trains and other modes of public transport are examples. 
    - Smart offices: eMBB can deliver high-bandwidth connections to hundreds of users in environments with heavy data traffic. 
    - Large-scale events: Concerts and sporting events may be served by eMBB, enabling high data rates where tens or hundreds of thousands of people are gathered. 
    - Enhanced multimedia: eMBB can provide seamless, high-definition video streaming, mobile TV and real-time content over broad coverage areas.





### 3.2 Massive Machine-Type Communications (mMTC) 

- mMTC
  - Means "large-scale connection" where thousands of devices can remain connected in relatively small area without compromising connection qualitiy
  - Providing connectivity to a massive number of low complexity narrow-bandwidth devices that infrequently send or receive small volumes of data



#### 3.2.1 Massive Internet of Things (mIoT) 



### 3.3 Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC) 

- URLLC

  - A service category that supports the latency sensitive services such as remote control, autonomous driving, and tactile internet

    

### 3.4 Network Slicing 

- Network Slicing
  - A network architecture that enables the multiplexing of virtualised and independent logical networks on the same physical network infrastructure
  - Each network slice is an isolated end-to-end network tailored to fulfil diverse requirements requested by a particular application





### 3.5 Beam Forming and Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) 

- Beam Forming
  - A traffic-signalling system for cellular base stations that identifies the most efficient data-delivery route to a particular user, and it reduces interference for nearby users in the process. 
  - Depending on the situation and the technology, there are several ways to implement it in 5G networks

- MIMO
  - A method for multiplying the capacity of a radio link using multiple transmission and receiving antennas to exploit multipath propagation
